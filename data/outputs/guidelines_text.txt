About The Logo
We are extremely proud of our Logo, and we would appreciate if you could follow 
these guidlines whenever you use it, to make sure it always shows its best.

As Neurons has evolved to focus much more on customer prediction rather than 
customer insights, our brand has also evolved.
Our Logo embodies much of Neurons’ bold spirit and innovative nature. The Logo is 
the combination of a simple and modern Typeface (Neurons) with the Icon. 
The Icon captures different meanings core to our brand  – simplicity, direction and 
iteration.
